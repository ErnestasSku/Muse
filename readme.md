# Muse

Image reference app for desktop and mobile.

## Road to MVP

- [x] Working desktop client
- [x] Working android client
- [x] Dragging files into desktop client
- [ ] P2P or other kind of communication between clients
- [ ] [BONUS] Improved image widget
  - [ ] Selected outline (with edge bubbles)
  - [ ] Resizing/Scaling
  - [ ] Rotation

Nice to have/Blocked:

- [ ] Draging images/data from browser into the app.
- [ ] Pasting images from clipboard.

This is currently not doable due to winit's limitation.

Future work:

- [ ] Custom GIF widget
  - [ ] Pausing/Resuming functionality
  - [ ] Next/Previous frame functionality
  - [ ] Frame preview
